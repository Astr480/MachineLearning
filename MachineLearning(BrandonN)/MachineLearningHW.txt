1) What do we call the technique of taking information we have about our problem (that is not
numerical) and turning it into numbers to use to build a feature matrix?
-Feature Engineering

2) What is one reason to start with a Naive Bayes model as your initial model when trying to
create a classifier?
-The Naive Bayes model is both fast and simple. Due to this, the speed is useful for an initial model
but it also has many parameters that can be tuned toward your specific problem. This allows it to
be a great starting point for many classifiers.


3) What model might you use to try and evaluate the data represented below? Why?
-I would use a k-means clustering model. This would take the points on the graph and
look for a pre-determine number of clusters in a unlabeled dataset. This is useful for the data
above since we can tell the machine that there are four clusters.

4) Explain one limitation or drawback to using machine learning techniques to analyze data.
-The biggest limitation is the need for training sets. This can often require a large set of data that
would be unavailable to us. 

5) What is an astronomical question that one could use machine learning to study? (State the
question and explain briefly)
-Machine learning can be used to identify transits. Since we have a large amount of data from surveys, we can input that data
into a machine and let it look for transits (which would see dips in intensity from the light of a star).
