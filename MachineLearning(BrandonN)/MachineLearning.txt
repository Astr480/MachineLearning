1) Describe the difference between “supervised” and “unsupervised” learning in your
own words.
Supervised learning is done with training and then tests to see if the training was successfull.
Unsupervised learning is done with just training and no tests. In the excerises we did,
we used supervised learning as we took a set of data we knew the "answer" to and tested to
see if our "learning" was successful

2) What is the difference between a training set and a testing set?
A training set is used by the program to teach the machine what it is looking for
A testing set is used to test if the learning was successful and if so, by how much.

3) What is the default data type cast in scikit-learn?
The default data type case is a .data

4) If n_samples == 5300, storing X as a numpy array of type float32 would require
how much RAM?
5300 * 100,000 * 4 byte = 2.12 x10^9 Bytes or 2.12 GB


5) What is a classifier? What is the advantage of using a simple classifier, like a “Naive
Bayes” classifier? 
A classifier is way to classify multiple types of objects in order to learn. It takes in
a set of data then uses its baseline to tell the machine what object is what. 

The advantage of using a simple classifier is speed. The Naive Bayes calssifier is much faster
than more advanced versions. Additionally, it can be used with few data points.
